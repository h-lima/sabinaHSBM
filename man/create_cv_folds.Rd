\title{Create cross-validation folds with guaranteed connectivity and maximum link removal.}
\usage{
create_cv_folds(com, n_folds = 5, min_per_row = 2, min_per_col = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{com}{A binary (0/1) matrix.}

\item{n_folds}{The number of folds to create. Defaults to 5.}

\item{min_per_row}{The minimum degree a row node must have for any of its
links to be considered for removal. Default is 2.}

\item{min_per_col}{The minimum degree a column node must have for any of its
links to be considered for removal. Default is 2.}
}
\value{
A matrix with columns \code{row}, \code{col}, and \code{fold_id}, indicating
the removed links and their assigned fold for testing.
}
\description{
This function identifies the maximum number of removable links and partitions
them into n_folds. It assigns links to folds to ensure that no
node becomes disconnected (i.e., has a degree of zero) in the training
matrix of any fold.
